Three CS problems that I slved with Arduino were fixing both programs so that they can together,how to declare methods, and how to read the number of lines of code you can have.. I learned what a while truen loop was used for.
To solcve the second problem which was how bright the lights could blink, we had to chang the low to high in the coding that controlledhow bright they blinked. The third problem that we solved was how to fix fix the tune of the music when the code for the number of beats because it was too low. I just learned how to program a motherboard to play musicwith a cool light show.
Another thing that  I learned was how to change the tune of the music by messin g with how slow or fast it was. Before this project if I was told to program a light show with music I wouldn't be able to do the task.
