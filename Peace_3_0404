My partner and I have created our own unique song on the motherboard.
To finish the project we will need to hook up the lights to finish the pattern of the song.
If everything goes well we might be able to turn it in on Friday.
The code changes we wrote were how the song sounds and how long it is.
The function that we created was the song that plays a catchy little tune.
