A class constructer is a thing that lets you create new classes.

Animation, hitbox and hit points should be included in this class because the orbs are going to be weapons so they need to take away health form the enemy or player.

The methods that the orb should have are moving, taking away player, or enemies health and  following the player because we want the orb to take away peoples health like a weapon or be an enemy to the player.
