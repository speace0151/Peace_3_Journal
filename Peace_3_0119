I created a slick game that takes place in the wild west. The story line is a girl trying to save her brother from a bunch of outlaws.
The challenges that I solved were fixing the walls in the map so you couldnt fall out of the world and fixing the health to the point where it doesnt go down.
I did not create my map and characters over winter brake because my laptop doesnt have linux and my moms does but she left it at home to update because she hasnt used it in years.

I was not able to meet the timeline because I was not able to upload the screens and antagonists. The good thing is that I have a working protagonist and map.
