    Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.
    private static void Cubed {
    {if(somenumber is picked multipy it 3 times);
    return true 
    }else{
    return false
    }
    }
    Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.
    int somenumber;
    int addthreetimes;
    int return true;
    Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student
    Public class Student{
    boolean hasBooks;
    int NumofBooks;
    boolean hasID;
    int NumofPencils;
    Student(int a, int b, int c, boolean d, boolean e, boolean f){
    this.NumofBooks = a;
    this.NumofPencils = b;
    this.hasBooks = c;
    this.hasPencils = d;
    this.hasID = e;
    }
    }
    Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?
If we were to do Arduino again, I would  program the arduino to play multiple songs that you can pause, skip, and listen to.
