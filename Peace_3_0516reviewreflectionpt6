    Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
    Give a specific code example for up-casting
    Give a specific code example for down-casting
    Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
    What is the range of values for byte? Why?

 An example for upcasting would be 
class C{}
class D extends clas C{}
C c1 = new D();

An example ofdowncasting would be 

Horse h = new Horse();

An example of converting a char to a String would be

String stringa = Character.toString(ch);

The range of values for byte is -128 to 127 because it is aa 8 bit integer followed by a 7 bit unassigned integer.
