    The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
    Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

I was in between the two because I remembered how to create an array but I didnt know how to make an array map. As of a result I
had to google how to make the map and look at past games to see how.

Ten questions that I think will be on the exam are:
1.How do you make an array?
2. What is the difference between a class and an object?
3. How do you create a class?
4.What is the purpose of a for loop?
5. How do you use a while loop?
6. How do you create a class with an array?
7. How do you make an array list?
8. What is the difference between java and assembly?
9.How do you create a game that asks for the users input and uses the input throughout the game?
10.How do make players and enemies in a game move?
List examples please
