I have noticed that Arduino is somewhat similar to netbeans becuase both tell you the lines where you need to fix the errors.
Both of the programs require you to run them to test your program out, and you can not run two programs at once..
The differences that I noticed are that the lines in arduino are not numbered like they are in netbeans.
The code adaptaions that I made were combining circuit four and eleven to make the light show and I changed the number of beats to create a unique tune that the lights follow.
The motherboard needs to be attached to the computer to create a circuit or it will not work.
Programs are complied with arduino by using the same code and the way of testing thins by running them.
