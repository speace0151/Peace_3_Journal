    In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten about. These will all be tested on the final exam!
    What is an array?
    
      An array is an ordered list of objects.
      
    How does one make a simple array of Strings?
    
    An example of an array would be 
    int[] something ={1,2,3,4,5};
    What is the syntax for a 2-D array?
    A 2d array would look like this:
    int [] [] z = new int[10] [10];
        z[0] = new int[10];
        z[1] = new int[10];
        z[2] = new int[10];
        z[3] = new int[10];
        z[4] = new int[10];
        z[5] = new int[10];
        z[6] = new int[10];
        z[7] = new int[10];
        z[8] = new int[10];
        z[9] = new int[10];
        
    What is the syntax for a 3-D array?
    the syntax for a 3d array would look like:
    
    int[][][] threeD = 
    {  { {1,   2,  3}, { 4,  5,  6}, { 7,  8,  9} },
       { {10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15}, {16, 17, 18} },
       { {19, 20, 21}, {22, 23, 24}, {25, 26, 27} } }
       
    How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]
    int[] something = {3}{4};
  
    What is the syntax for a while loop?
    while (boolean)
    Why use while loops in your game?
    -To repeat cretain methods
    Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
