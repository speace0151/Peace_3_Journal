    Explain in your own words -- what happens with nested for loops?
    E.g.,

            for (int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++) {
                        for (int j = 0; j <= board[1].length - 1; j++) { ....}
          

Nested for loops repeat everything inside of them because it is a for loop inside a for loop.
