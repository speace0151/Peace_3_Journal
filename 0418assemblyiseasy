The code we wrote for assembly was not easy.
You had to type elf64 because it is a 64 bit code.
we used ld because it was a light directory.
We did not use chmod because we did not need to change any permissions.

global _start

        section .text
_start:
        ; write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1          
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        mov     rdx, 15
        syscall

        ; exit(0)
        mov     eax, 60
        xor     rdi, rdi
        syscall
message:
        db       "Samantha Peace",10    
I got my code to work by changing the one near rsi to message.
