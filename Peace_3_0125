To make my game more successful I could have worked on it more on Christmas Break. I should have downloaded Netbeans and pushed my game to Github so that the map design would be finished. If I had done that I could have had more time to figure out the code to make more enemies and find out why the items you were supposed to collect didnt show.
To solve some of the problems that I encountered I had to change the code for the enemy so that it would appear and to fix the screen I had to make the Image bigger.
