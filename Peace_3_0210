1.Why wont the picture for the orbs show up. Ive cipied the directory corrctly spelled everything correctly but the Image wont show.

this.orbpic = new Image("res/orbs/Ninja_12.png");

2.I dont understand why this line is stopping the game:orb = new Orb((int)Player.x, (int) Player.y);
if(orb.isIsVisible()){
    orb.orbpic.draw(orb.getX(), orb.getY());
}
There are no red errors and everything is spelled correctly so does it go in the init class or did I miss place it.

3.I keep getting errors from this line:
appgc.start();
I dont know what it does and my game keeps telling me that something is wrong with it. How do I fix the line?
