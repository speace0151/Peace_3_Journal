The ten concepts that I think will be on the test will be:
Assembly- because we played a game that was similar to it
Coding commands we learned on netbeans, because we went over them all year
Vocabulary, because we need to know certain words and what they mean in coding
getters and setter because we dedicated one day to learning the difference
Methods, because ever since school started we have been practicing how to make one
booleans-we have been reviewing them when we were coding our games.
Arrays-we have been reviewing them when we were coding our games.
Arraylists-we have been reviewing them when we were coding our games.
for loops-we have been reviewing them when we were coding our games.
objects-we have been reviewing them when we were coding our games.
